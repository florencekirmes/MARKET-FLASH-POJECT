MarketFlash Project
Enhancing Business Operations with Data Insights

Introduction
We will be presenting to you the project we've been working on for MarketFlash, a growing marketing company. Our goal was to design and build a powerful database and an insightful dashboard to help MarketFlash manage their data more effectively and make informed business decisions.

Project Objectives
Our main objectives for this project were to:
Transition Market Flash's data from spreadsheets to a more scalable and structured database.
Design a database that captures all necessary information about campaigns, clients, channels,and employees.
Create a user-friendly dashboard that provides clear visibility into business performance and key metrics.
MarketFlash initially faced several challenges:
Managing a large volume of data in spreadsheets, which was becoming inefficient and error-prone.
Lack of centralized data storage, making it difficult to retrieve and analyze information.
The need for a comprehensive dashboard to visualize key business metrics and trends.
To address these challenges, we followed a structured methodology:
Conducted interviews with Markus to understand the business requirements.
Analyzed the existing data to design a functional ER diagram for the database.
Cleaned the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Implemented the database design using SQL, ensuring all keys, datatypes, and constraints were correctly set up.
Created and iterated over a dashboard design based on Markus’s feedback, using Tableau for visualization."

FUNCTIONAL ER Diagram
This is the ER diagram we designed for MarketFlash’s database. It includes four main entities: Campaigns, Clients, Employees, and Channels, along with their relationships. Each campaign is associated with one client, one channel, and one employee managing it. This structure ensures data integrity and supports efficient querying and reporting."

Database
We Normalized our database and removed redundancy.
We identified several data quality issues. These include: Duplicate records, missing values, Inconsistent data formats.
After cleaning the data, we achieved a significant reduction in duplicates and improved the completeness of our data. This has enhanced the reliability of our market analyses and decision-making processes.
